# SQL- This is my home to all things SQL. I am a Self-Taught Data Analyst, who is continuing to learn as I go on a daily basis. 
This repository is meant to highlight my knowledge and skills of SQL ranging from the basics (SKILLS 1), 
intermediate (SKILLS 2) and Advanced (SKILLS 3) as well as any portfolio projects I have completed. **The Skills demonstrated came from watching
Alex the Analysts YouTube channel and altered to work in BigQuery. 
Thank you for taking a look.
